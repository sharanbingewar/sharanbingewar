# üåü About Me

Hi! I'm **Sai Sharan Bingewar**, a software engineer who enjoys using technology to solve everyday problems. My curiosity about how systems work together led me to dive into **networking**, **database management**, and **data security**. These areas have fascinated me, and they continue to guide my work.

Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing a **Master‚Äôs in Computer Science** at **Concordia University**. This program helps me build on my previous experiences and allows me to explore new areas of tech, pushing me to think about problems in different ways and find better solutions.

## üöÄ My Mission

I believe technology should be a tool that makes life easier and more efficient. My goal is to create software that not only solves problems but also provides a smooth and enjoyable experience for users. Whether I‚Äôm integrating **RESTful APIs** or figuring out complex **algorithms**, I aim to make a difference through technology.

## üåç Interests & Hobbies

When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy getting outdoors and hiking. I recently reached the top of a **12,500 ft** peak, which reminded me how important it is to face challenges head-on. This mindset helps me both in life and when working on tough coding problems.

### üìö Lifelong Learning

During my time at **Concordia University**, I‚Äôve had the chance to study some really interesting topics, like **mobile computer architecture** and **language theory**. These courses have helped me think more deeply about how computers work and how software is built. My experience as a **Regression Test Engineer** at **TCS** also taught me the importance of testing and making sure software works properly, which has been a key part of my approach to development.
